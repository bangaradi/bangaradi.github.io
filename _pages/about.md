Hi!
I am Aditya Bangar, a junior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I have a deep interest in both Systems and Machine Learning.

My academic journey has been enriched with research experience in areas like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Affective Computing. Recently, through coursework at IIT Kanpur, I've developed a keen interest in the study of Computer Systems, especially in the realms of Operating Systems and Parallel Computing.
